        <h3>Spaghetti alla Carbonara - A delicious Italian dishe</h3>

        <p>
            Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta,
            and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or
            onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes
            straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.  </li>
            <li>
                Guanciale: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find
                it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spaghetti: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can
                substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. 
            </li>
            <li>Eggs: Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
            <li>
                Cheese: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if
                preferred.
            </li>
            <li>
                Seasonings: This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and
                pepper. 
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.</li>

        <h4>Notes and tips from the chef:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta quickly while pouring the egg mixture
                over it.
            </li>
