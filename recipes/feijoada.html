        <h3>Feijoada a tipicaly Brazilian dishe</h3>

        <p>
            This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean 
            stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional
            meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent 
            served over brown rice.
