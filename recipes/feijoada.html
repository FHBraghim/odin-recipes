        <h3>Feijoada a tipicaly Brazilian dishe</h3>

        <p>
            This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean 
            stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional
            meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent 
            served over brown rice.

                Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onio, green onions, and
                garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes.

            <li>
                Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring 
                to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or 
                until tender.
